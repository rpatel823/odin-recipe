      <li>2 cups white rice</li>
      <li>2/3 cup soy sause</li>
      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cornstarch, minced ginger, minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>3 chicken breast halves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp seasame oil</li>
      <li>1 head broccoli, broken into florets</li>

      <li>1 can, or 8 ounces, water chestnuts drained</li>
      <li>1 greenbell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat
        to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has
        been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium
        glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and
        red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in
        the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper;
        cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables
        into a dish; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just
        browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved
        marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink
        in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over
        rice.
