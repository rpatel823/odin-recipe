    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="info">
      These crustless grilled cheese sandwiches are great to have stashed in the
      freezer for when the kids need a quick snack. Easy for little hands to
      hold, with the cheese sealed inside and no tough crusts, theyâ€™re fun for
      them and convenient for you. You will need a sandwich sealer for this
      recipe, and they are easy to find online.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 slices white sandwich bread</li>
      <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of butter onto 1 side of each slice of bread.</li>
      <li>
        Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly smaller than the sandwich
        sealer, press out round slices of cheese. Lay 4 slices of bread on a
        work surface, buttered side down. Place a cheese round in the center of
        each slice. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, buttered side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich, press the sealer down, and
        hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to 30 seconds. Pull the crusts
        away from the sealer; discard. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 2
        hours before transferring into a freezer bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Cook frozen
        sandwiches until golden, about 5 minutes. If sandwiches are thawed, cook
        3 minutes at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C).

    </ol>
